To be honest, I'm 5w3d and I haven't even made a full decision yet. I'm leaning towards abortion because of all the logical reasons people have stated, some here on this sub, but there's still a part of me that knows I could be a good parent even at this point in my life (I'm financially stable, have the support of my parents, etc) I'm just lucky enough to live somewhere that doesn't restrict abortions so I have time to think about it.

I added MF mainly because I liked the pure math aspect, and my course schedule allowed me to fit all required courses without taking extra terms (although I needed to take 6 courses per term as a result).\n\n\nThe upper year Pmath courses will require significantly more brainpower over the already tough Stat/ActSci courses, unless you are naturally good at proofs and understanding the material. There are rarely formulas to memorize compared to Stats/ActSci, and way more complex concepts which take time to digest after each lecture. Assignments take up significantly more time as you will be proving a lot of things instead of doing calculations, and it often takes days for the solution to \"click\" in your mind.\n\n\nIn terms of career path, I plan to continue down ActSci by pursuing actuarial designations; MF is more of an interest/side goal. Make good use of your coops and you might discover a path you really want to pursue. At the end all that matters are your coops, assuming you will be looking for a job after graduation instead of doing grad school.\n\n\nYou sound interested enough in the pure math aspect which makes a the single best reason to want to do MF. I would suggest switching into the advanced math classes if you haven't already (MATH 145 + 147). These give you a feel of whether you enjoy/can handle all the theory and proofs in the later PMATH courses, and saves you from having to take an extra course for PMATH 351's requirement.

Either way, it's kind of a blinding problem. People vary in how much they're consciously and subconsciously biased by learning things but obviously it changes your perception in some way. My point is there exists a real possibility just because of how humans work, and even the smartest prof is human/emotional.\n\nFor example, it's possible a prof could see that a student has a history of low grades and subconsciously give less credit to their logic on slightly vague statements. Or they could feel sympathetic about people close to failing out, especially if it's a student they like. There are already many profs who vary in how specific you have to be with wording and those situations naturally manifest *some* bias of *some* sort.", "author": "downstreameffector"}, {"data": "So the point went right over your heard.

Again, there's also no reason for people who aren't academic advisors or in some other separated administrative position to know.\n\nEDIT: Proof you're calling me out on something I literally covered in the comment you're responding to\n\n> I doubt profs would just go browsing students grades for no reason, but if they all have access it's possible\n\nCould happen. No reason for it to happen.

They need to find a way to challenge them somehow. In my offerings it was incredibly common for the raw marks to have a bimodal distribution where the average student would be getting 50s while the IMO students would be getting 90s. But at the end of the day everyone who stayed enjoyed the courses and most of them at the very least passed.\n\nInstead, take a closer look at your comprehension of the lectures. Do you think you can pass? Are you understanding the lectures and learning anything from them? Are you legitimately finding them fascinating and engaging?  \nIf the answer to any of them is \"no\", then you should consider dropping down. You're paying hundreds of dollars for each of those courses; for that amount of money you should at least be learning something. There's also the fact that many of the concepts in the first year courses (13X/14X) provide the foundation for a lot of the concepts you'll learn in future courses; if you're having trouble understanding them now then it'll be a lot more difficult to try to comprehend them - as well as anything that builds onto them - in the future. And finally, if you're not even enjoying them, why are you wasting your time with them? This is the beginning of the term; if you're frustrated now, it's only gonna go downhill from here.\n\nHowever, if you're at least understanding what's being taught in class and are finding it interesting, then if you think you can pass you should definitely consider staying in. If you feel you're up to it then the 14X courses present an opportunity to learn much of the content in an entirely different - often more thorough - way from the 13X courses, and if you're thinking of PMATH then they're usually taught in a style similar to the upper-year PMATH courses (and also usually recommended if not required). If you are enjoying how the material is handled and the depth and thoroughness and rigour of it, then definitely consider staying; you'll find these courses more interesting and worthwhile than the 13X versions.\n\nUltimately the decision is up to you. Please just know that just because you're not understanding A1 perfectly, it doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't be in them.\n\nSincerely, a 4th year MathPhys student who dropped from 14X and didn't regret it one bit (and has many friends who stayed without regretting it)", "author": "maractite"}, {"data": "Any gluten contamination leaves me with symptoms comparable to a really bad flu/really bad stomach flu (combined) for ~2 weeks.

However, instances of this are rare, and the potential for abuse offsets any consumer benefit this would provide. In these cases, it would be better to outright increase data caps for all services.  \n2) My main concern is providers implementing differential pricing, then changing data plans to effectively prevent customers from using any other service. (for example, changing data pricing so $60 will get you 2GB of data, then 1GB, then 250MB, then no data at all unless you're using their approved services)  \n3) I feel that zero-rating should not be implemented. Rather than compete by offering \"incentives\" through preferential treatment for a few select apps, the providers should compete through providing more general benefits to consumers through cheaper/larger data plans and allow consumers to choose the services the consumer wants to use, rather than force consumers to use the provider's approved services.  \n4) The best method of regulating differential pricing is to prevent it outright, and let providers compete by providing incentives such as higher caps/cheaper data to consumers.", "author": "maractite"}, {"data": "Looks like New for 145 and Marcoux for 147\n\nHeh, it was actually one of djao's offerings that I dropped.

Many universities also waive many prereq courses for people completing a second degree (if you decide to pursue a different degree down the road). If you can find a grad program that is even remotely related to your field - you may be able to branch out to another field via way of a masters degree.\n\nMost jobs these days require some sort of degree (or diploma/certificate, etc) - but if there is something that REALLY piques your interest that you can do without a bachelors degree - it may be a reason to halt your studies (you can always go back to finish your degree later if you feel it necessary to do so).

Cool.)\n\nHeya, author of the aforementioned software here. Heard around the grapevine that it was mentioned around here, and since there's some misinformation floating around I thought I'd weigh in. It looks like I ended up writing a lot, so feel free to skip to the end if you're in a rush.\n\n@RedDot3ND: I don't think I've ever taken any shots directed at you or your software, so I'd prefer that there isn't any animosity where none was intended.\n\nI wrote my software primarily, for, well, myself. I'm very paranoid about security and like reverse engineering things, so it was inevitable that I'd eventually write a launcher for BNS myself \u2014 I've done so for practically every online game I've ever played. After auth tokens were enforced and your software (which I was using at the time) stopped working, I figured I'd take a crack at it for fun. My original plan had been to get a patch for your software working and send it to you, but by the time I had one working you mentioned in your thread you were almost done yours, so I figured I'd just wrap mine in a small UI and put it out there so that it may help someone out there who can't use your software, or prefers an alternative to the popular choice.\n\nI had originally planned to emulate the login STS communication (like your software currently does), but figured that there were too many moving parts to reliably get right (all of that data it sends in the Connect packet, for example \u2014 it seems it'd be trivial for NCsoft to add another field in there and throw a wrench in login emulation). It looks like you got it functioning for now, though, so kudos on that.\n\nNow, regarding the misinformation: my software can't be \"easily\" patched, far from a \"single dll\" to change. And as far as my understanding of the EULA goes, it's exactly as bannable as your software \u2014 which is to say, not very, as Babbletr0n mentioned that so long as you're not gaining a competitive advantage, NCsoft doesn't really care.\n\nIn a reality where NCsoft actually cared and tried to block it, by nature of being loaded before the launcher has a chance to initialize, it can effectively stub out almost anything NCsoft might try to do w.r.t. detection. Adding Xigncode3 to the launcher? That can be stubbed out too, and IIRC there's a fork already that has the capability to do just that. Protocol hacks have tended to be more finicky to keep stable / functioning at all, at least in the game reverse engineering scenes I've been part of till now. The progression of companies cracking down on 3rd-party software has always started with patching up the protocol, eventually culminating in a cat-and-mouse game at the compiled code level.\n\nThere'll always be users for whom \"injection\" is synonymous with \"big dirty hack\", and would prefer to use a login shim instead, and vice-versa those who would prefer injection to logging in through a 3rd-party form that emulates the real launcher. Different strokes for different folks.\n\nTo wrap things up, I've always found it silly how \u2014 especially when it comes to games \u2014 developers seem to be allergic to each other's projects, simply because they exist. We both wrote software because we like BNS, and want to help make it more accessible to others.\n\nI don't think there should be much more to it than that.", "author": "Pwnclub"}, {"data": "This might be it: https://clips.twitch.tv/HonestSteamyQueleaRickroll", "author": "Pwnclub"}, {"data": "Ok, thanks :D", "author": "Pwnclub"}, {"data": "The reason why I wanted to delete it is that people on this subreddit typically don't like first years asking \"basic\", for lack of a better term, questions (much preferring shitposting :P) and downvote the posts quite heavily to get them off the front page.

So after your bachelors you can pay for a masters, or go straight to a phd if you have good enough qualifications.\n\nBecoming a professor is extremely difficult. You need to be an excellent researcher and then work your way up the ladder as an assistant, then adjunct, then tenured professor. If you decide during your bachelors that you dont want to do research, you can easily get a job in finance, programming, or even engineering. Programming especially will be easy if you learn to program during your bachelors, since you learn more than enough math and a physics degree will require you to do some code for simulation/computation anyway. There are lots of jobs in that field.\n\nTalk to your teacher about writing the CAP physics exam! Also the Sir Isaac Newton physics contest, and the euclid mathematics contest.

Personally, I'd recommend Spanish, given how easy it is to learn and how widespread it is, and how much variation in culture (music, traditions, media) you can unlock just by knowing it.

The US government has made categories to identify the different classes of language, in terms of how long it usually takes them to bring diplomats up to speed. [This}(http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty) shows those classes, and you can see that Chinese/Japanese/Korean take almost 4 times as long as French and Spanish, so you have to REALLY want to learn those ones.

The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1917\u20131991), and the Soviet Union (1922\u20131991) more broadly, had a long history of state atheism, whereby those seeking social success generally had to profess atheism and to stay away from houses of worship; this trend became especially militant during the middle Stalinist era from 1929 to 1939.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Christianity/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.27", "author": "WikiTextBot"}, {"data": "**Four-bar linkage**\n\nA four-bar linkage, also called a four-bar, is the simplest movable closed chain linkage.
